# WELFake News Classification

This project focuses on classifying fake news from the real ones using WELFake dataset. This dataset is part of a Kaggle competition. We implemented two ML algorithms: Support Vector Machine(SVM) and Naive Bayes.

The dataset consists of features "Title" and "Text" which are labelled (0 for fake and 1 for real).
